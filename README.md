# Extended Job Database

This is an extended job database, where we have the following subprojects:

- [kubernetes](kubernetes): Generate a dataset of Kubernetes Job abstractions (and jobset too, TODO)
- [issues](issues): We want to understand what features for workload managers people are asking for (and not getting) so possibly we can parse the GitHub issues boards and do something with that data. This is the data.
- [manual](manual): I am going to carefully go through the abstractions for Jobs in Kubernetes, and come up with a list of things I think Kubernetes can support (and HPC cannot).
